This Attendance Tracker is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that enables users to manage and monitor student attendance efficiently. It allows the addition of students with numeric IDs and names, marking their attendance as present or absent on specific dates—restricted to today or past dates to ensure accurate record-keeping. The interface dynamically hides attendance options once a status is marked for a day, preventing duplicate entries. Users can search by student ID to view the complete attendance history across all dates, offering a comprehensive overview of each student's records. Attendance data is persistently stored in the browser’s local storage for seamless data retrieval, and the system supports exporting attendance records as CSV files for external use. The clean, responsive design with color-coded buttons enhances usability and visual clarity, making the tracker both functional and user-friendly for everyday attendance management.
